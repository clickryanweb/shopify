/- Homepage tiles. 
	/We need a way for the user to add "Full width image", 

	or half width image 
		and have it appear as shown. 

	/> 



/- I think we could do this 
	by just setting the section 
		to float 
		and then the CMS editor controls the image uploaded. 





/- Need to consider that some images will be half width, 
	some will be full width. 


	/>



/- Homepage tiles, 
	- image text White / Bold. 
	- Background transparent



	/> new section to apply the tiles
		so say if client want's to still use the original design it is still available
