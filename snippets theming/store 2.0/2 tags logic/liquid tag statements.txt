//Allows you to have a block of Liquid without delimeters on each tag.

Because the tags don't have delimeters, each tag needs to be on its own line.


// variables, conditions, etc.

ex:


{% liquid
  # Show a message that's customized to the product type

  assign product_type = product.type | downcase
  assign message = ''

  case product_type
    when 'health'
      assign message = 'This is a health potion!'
    when 'love'
      assign message = 'This is a love potion!'
    else
      assign message = 'This is a potion!'
  endcase

  echo message
%}
