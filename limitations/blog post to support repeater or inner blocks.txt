Shopify does 
	not natively support a metafield type that directly acts as a repeater (e.g., an array of multiple values with different types) 
	or allows for inner blocks in the blog post editor. 

However, you can implement a similar functionality using JSON metafields and custom Liquid code.


---

repeaters or inner blocks in Shopify are currently limited to the Theme Editor and custom sections.
