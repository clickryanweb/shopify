possible issues:

- Schema Error, check json format


! Theme File Compatibility:

If your theme uses a JSON template structure (e.g., templates/page.faq.json), you need to ensure that the section is added to the JSON template under the sections key.
Example for a page.faq.json file:


{
    "sections": {
        "main": {
            "type": "faq",
            "settings": {}
        }
    },
    "order": [
        "main"
    ]
}

Steps to Debug:
- Verify the File Exists:
	Confirm that faq.liquid is saved in the sections/ directory.

- Add Section to a Page:

	Insert {% section 'faq' %} into the relevant page template, such as templates/page.faq.liquid.


- Check for Errors in the Console:

	Open the browser's developer tools to check for JavaScript or Liquid errors that might prevent the section from rendering.


- Preview in Customize Editor:

	Navigate to Customize in your Shopify Admin, then check the page or section category where the FAQ section should appear.

Home Page (index.liquid or templates/index.json)

- Shopify homepages use the index template, which allows dynamic sections.

- Open templates/index.json and ensure that the FAQ section is declared there:


{
    "sections": {

        "faq-section": {
            "type": "faq",
            "settings": {}
        }
    },


    "order": [
        "faq-section"
    ]
}
