│   staff member access. If you want to use Shopify CLI to work on a           │
│  development store, then you should be the store owner or create a staff     │
│  account on the store.                                                       │

│  If you're the store owner, then you need to log in to the store directly    │
│  using the store URL at least once (for example, using                       │
│  "https://surewebsolution.myshopify.com/admin") before you log in using      │
│  Shopify CLI. Logging in to the Shopify admin directly connects the          │
│  development store with your Shopify login.
