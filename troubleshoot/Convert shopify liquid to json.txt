Convert shopify liquid to json

https://youtu.be/nehucqqODT0?si=gjbhxLHzcMJ3DPJM

Basically it is converting liquid files in the  templates folder and the new json files will just reference liquid files i.e. copied in the sections folder 



//note

- no need to add section tag once the file is in section folder
