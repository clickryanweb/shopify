1. Check for Theme Editor Features

•	Go to your Shopify admin and navigate to:
Online Store > Themes > Customize (for the active theme).

•	Look for the following Online Store 2.0 features in the theme editor:
o	Sections Everywhere: Ability to add dynamic sections on all pages (not just the homepage).
o	Theme App Extensions: Blocks provided by installed apps that you can add directly to your theme.
o	Metafield Integration: Fields like product specifications or extra details are integrated into the theme editor without requiring Liquid code changes.

2. Review the Theme Architecture

	1.	Check for JSON Templates:
o	Go to Online Store > Themes > Actions > Edit Code.
o	Look under the templates folder.
o	Online Store 2.0 themes use JSON templates (e.g., product.json, collection.json). If you see .liquid templates for product or collection pages (e.g., product.liquid), it’s an older theme.


	2.	Asset Structure:
o	OS 2.0 themes typically have a sections folder with reusable section files.
o	Older themes may rely more heavily on snippets for dynamic content.

3. Verify Metafield Support
•	Navigate to Settings > Custom Data in the Shopify admin.
•	Add or edit metafields.
•	Check if the theme displays these metafields automatically or requires custom Liquid coding. OS 2.0 themes fully support metafields in the theme editor.
